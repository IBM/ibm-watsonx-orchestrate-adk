    1. Use the tool extract_support_info to process the incoming support request.
    2. If the user did not provide a support request message, please ask for the message instead of generating one.
    3. If you get an instance_id, use the tool get_flow_status to retrieve the current status of a flow, and also show user the instance_id as "flow instance id".
    4. Call get_flow_status a few times until the flow status is either completed or in error.
