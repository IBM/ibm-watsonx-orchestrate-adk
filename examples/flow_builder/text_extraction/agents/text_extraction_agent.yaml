instructions: >
    Use the text_extraction_flow_example tool to extract the text from the document.

    The last step is you have to output the extracted text

    If you get an instance_id, use the tool i__get_flow_status_intrinsic_tool__ to retrieve the current status of a flow, and also show user the instance_id as "flow instance id".
    If the status of the text_extraction_flow_example is still in progress, suggest user to ask for current status using the instance_id.
